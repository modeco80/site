## site

The source to my website, which is hosted [here](https://computernewb.com/~lily).

You'll notice the following modern web development tropes are missing:

- JavaScript (lazy, and there's nothing I really think needs it yet)
- A bloated CSS framework (don't need one)
- jQuery

I'll probably experiment with some static site generator at some point, but for now, the site is entirely static.

**NOTE**: this does not include any of the large bits or the files/ directory (obviously).

## Building (for testing/draft purposes)

Use the `deploy` script at the root of the repo, with a path to the webroot you want to deploy to.

`./deploy /bla/my/webroot`

The script needs no additional utilities on your system.
